"""End-of-run artifact publisher for remote backends.

Invoked as ``python -m lqh.remote.publish <run_dir>`` on the remote
machine after a successful train/infer run. Walks the run dir,
classifies each output, uploads to R2 via ``api.lqh.ai``, and writes
an ``artifacts.json`` manifest in the run dir that the client picks
up on the next rsync.

This replaces the previous "rsync everything including multi-GB
checkpoints back over SSH" path. Only the manifest + small files
(metrics, status, logs) flow over SSH after this; heavy artifacts
go remote → R2 → client directly via presigned URLs when needed.

Designed to be self-contained: stdlib + httpx, no lqh.train deps.
Auth and API base come from environment variables sourced by the
launcher (lqh/remote/ssh_direct.py writes them into
``.lqh-env/.env``).
