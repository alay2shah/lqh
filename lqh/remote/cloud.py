"""Cloud remote backend — runs jobs on api.lqh.ai.

The GPU provider is a backend-implemented detail; the user only sees
``api.lqh.ai``. This backend mirrors the SSH-direct ``RemoteBackend``
contract so ``RemoteRunWatcher`` doesn't need to know which path is
in use — it reads ``progress.jsonl`` / ``status.json`` / ``stdout.log``
either way.

Disconnect resilience is a first-class concern: the SSE stream carries
a monotonically increasing ``seq`` per job. We persist the last seen
``seq`` to ``<run_dir>/cloud_state.json`` after every event so that:

  * A laptop sleeping mid-fine-tune resumes from the gap on next wake.
  * A client crash and reopen sees the same.
  * Server-side history (``cloud_job_events`` table) replays missed
    events when the consumer reconnects with ``?last_seq=N``.

Cancellation is hooked to ``teardown`` and propagates to the cloud
runner; the server flips ``cloud_jobs.status='cancelled'`` and emits a
final status event that the consumer writes to ``status.json``.
