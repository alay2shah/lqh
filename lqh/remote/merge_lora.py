"""In-sandbox LoRA merge for merge-and-serve (INFERENCE.md §2).

``python -m lqh.remote.merge_lora`` runs inside the CPU sandbox the
backend launches for a ``merge_lora`` cloud job (deployments push of a
LoRA artifact). Flow:

1. download the adapter tar from R2 via the presigned
   ``LQH_MERGE_ADAPTER_URL``,
2. load ``LQH_MERGE_BASE_MODEL`` (HF) + adapter with PEFT and
   ``merge_and_unload()`` into full weights,
3. publish the merged checkpoint back through the normal artifact
   register path (``lqh.remote.publish``) with a lineage row marking it
   a *full* checkpoint derived from the base model.

The backend's merge pump then attaches the published checkpoint to the
deployment and drives the pod deploy. CPU-only on purpose: a merge is a
weight addition, memory-bound not compute-bound, and keeping it off
GPUs keeps the one-time merge cost trivial.

Required env (injected by the backend):
    LQH_MERGE_BASE_MODEL    HF repo id of the base model
    LQH_MERGE_ADAPTER_URL   presigned GET for the adapter tar
    LQH_JOB_ID              the merge_lora cloud job id
    LQH_PROJECT_ID          project the merged artifact registers under
    LQH_BASE_URL            api base for artifact registration
    LQH_API_TOKEN           scoped job token (artifacts.write)
Optional:
    HF_TOKEN                for gated base models
