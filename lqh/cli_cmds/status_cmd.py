"""`lqh status [--json]` — project state at a glance (CLI_PLAN §4.8.5).

Serializes the same attention signals the agent sees at startup
(lqh/signals.py) plus the run-directory scan. Local-first: remote/cloud
runs are polled best-effort with a bounded timeout; on failure the
signals say states may be stale instead of pretending freshness.
