"""The single home for recommended training hyperparameters.

Every default the product trains at lives here, not inlined in the tool
handler. There are two reasons this is worth its own module:

1. **The defaults are now load-bearing.** ``start_training`` no longer sweeps
   SFT by default (see ``lqh/skills/train/SKILL.md``) — the first run is a
   single run at these values, and the sweep is the late-stage "squeeze out
   more" lever. A default that is merely plausible is no longer good enough.
2. **The learning rate is measured; everything else is not.**
   ``tests/benchmarks/hp_defaults`` runs a factorial study over task × dataset
   size × model (base/instruct) × model size and reports the config with the
   lowest mean regret against each cell's oracle. Its output is a data-only
   edit to this file plus a ``PROVENANCE`` update — nothing else moves. Its
   stage-A screen has run and set the text LoRA learning rate; ``PROVENANCE``
   records the run, the regret, and four limits on how far that generalises —
   including that its report is not archived here. Everything else in this file
   (epoch count, batch sizes, LoRA shape, DPO knobs) is an unmeasured literal,
   and the per-value comments say which is which.

``recommended()`` is the only entry point for a *new* run's hyperparameters:
callers must not invent their own values or copy a literal out of this file. The
one legitimate re-derivation is by this module's own helpers — a sweep child
whose grid point changes ``num_epochs`` calls :func:`sft_effective_batch` again
(``lqh.train.sweep._rederive_sft_batch``) so its batch matches what a standalone
run at those hyperparameters would get.

    "shipped config). A customer's 1.2B task separately gained +1.30 from a "
    "hand-set 5e-4, a value the study never tested. (4) 5 of the 6 contributing "
