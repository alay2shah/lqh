    #      dataset x large auto-tuned batch means a 2-epoch run may have

    #      carries no eval_loss, and the sweep proxy is missing for
    #      every config (sweep fails with "wrote no proxy metric").

    #      is actually saved (post load_best_model_at_end), which is
    #      what the sweep is selecting between. Trainer.evaluate() logs
    #      its metrics into state.log_history, so the dump below picks
