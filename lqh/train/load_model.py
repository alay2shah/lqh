"""Unified model loading for HF Hub IDs, merged dirs, and PEFT adapter dirs.

A "model path" in lqh configs (``base_model`` in sft / dpo / infer) can now
be any of three things, and downstream consumers should not care which:

- ``"hub"``     — a HF Hub id like ``"LiquidAI/LFM2-1.2B"`` (no local dir).
- ``"merged"``  — a local dir containing ``config.json`` + weights.
- ``"adapter"`` — a local dir containing ``adapter_config.json`` and
                  adapter weights (typically ``adapter_model.safetensors``).

This module classifies a path and dispatches to the right ``from_pretrained``
chain. Adapter dirs are produced by :mod:`lqh.train.sft` when
``lora.merge=False`` — the artifact is ~tens of MB instead of multi-GB
merged model, which sidesteps publish-time tar OOMs on resource-bounded
sandboxes.

Backwards compatibility: anything that worked before (hub id, merged dir)
keeps working with no config change. Detection is automatic.

Reference-model gotcha (for DPO): when starting from an adapter dir, both
the policy and the reference model must be loaded through
:func:`load_for_training` so they share the same effective starting point
(base + pre-existing adapter merged in). Loading the reference from a
bare base id while the policy starts from an adapter dir produces wrong
KL — the older DPO code path silently did this.
