"""Headless background-job supervisor (CLI_PLAN §4.5, phase 4).

Extracted from ``LqhApp`` so the TUI and headless surfaces (`lqh run`,
`lqh tool call training_status --wait`) share ONE implementation of:

- the job registry (``BackgroundTaskRegistry`` + last-state tracking),
- the periodic scan/watch loop that detects ``running → terminal``
  transitions, finalizes runs (manifests, cloud data-gen downloads),
  spawns scoring/sync watchers, and records completion notices,
- parking (``wait_for_runs``): suspend until a watched run is terminal.

UI and telemetry side effects stay in the caller via ``SupervisorHooks``
— every hook is optional, so a bare ``JobSupervisor(project_dir)`` is a
fully functional headless supervisor. This module must not import the
TUI or telemetry.
