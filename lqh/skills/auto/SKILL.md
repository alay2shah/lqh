# Skill: Auto Mode

You are running in **auto mode**. There is no user. From now until the run
ends, every decision must be made by you. This file is **always in scope**
(it is injected as a sticky system message and survives compaction and
sub-skill loads); the per-stage skills you load (`data_generation`,
`data_filtering`, `evaluation`, `train`) sit on top of it for stage-level
guidance, but this skill remains the source of truth for the overall plan.

## Hard rules

1. **Never call `ask_user`.** There is no user to answer. If you feel the
   urge to ask, instead: log your reasoning in plain text, pick a sensible
   default, and continue. Calling `ask_user` will be intercepted and you
   will be told to resolve it yourself — do not re-try.
2. **Always end with `exit_auto_mode`.** The run terminates only when you
   call `exit_auto_mode(status, reason)` with `status="success"` or
   `status="failure"`. If you produce a turn without a tool call, you will
   be nudged with "please continue" — interpret that as "keep going" and
   make further progress, do not stop.
3. **Report stage transitions.** Whenever you advance to a new pipeline
   stage, call `set_auto_stage(stage, note?)` so the TUI can show the user
   what's happening. Use the canonical stage names listed below.
4. **Permission prompts auto-grant.** Tools that would normally ask the
   user for execution permission (pipelines, HF push) auto-grant
   project-wide in auto mode. You do not need to handle them specially.
5. **Wait for runs with a single `training_status` call.** After starting an
   SFT/DPO/eval run, call `training_status(run_name=...)` **once** when you
   need the result. While a run is still active that call blocks until the
   run reaches a terminal state and then returns the final status — it does
   not return "running". Do **not** poll in a loop or invent your own
   wait/sleep: one call per run is enough, and it spends zero LLM cycles
   while waiting (the user watches live step/percent progress in the status
   bar meanwhile). The call only returns once the run is genuinely done.
6. **An interrupted cloud job is not a reason to loop.** A `[System: ...]`
   failure notification names the class and the recovery step; follow that
   step rather than the label. For any interruption class (preempted /
   orphaned / interrupted / timeout) you get **one** retry per pipeline
   stage, and it must be a *smaller* job than the one that died. Note that
   `timeout` is a sizing problem rather than infrastructure, and
   `interrupted` may be an out-of-memory in disguise — in both cases the
   smaller retry is the point, not an optional courtesy. Never resubmit the identical
   shape, never treat a resubmit as a resume (it starts from step 0), and
   if the reduced retry also fails, call `exit_auto_mode(status="failure",
   ...)` naming the class, the attempts, and the GPU cost. Burning the
   user's credits on blind retries is a worse outcome than a clean,
   explained failure.

## Goal

Take the spec at `SPEC.md` (already in your context) and produce a
fine-tuned model that meaningfully outperforms the zero-shot baseline. The
final report is the standard results table. The terminal states are:

- **success** — a checkpoint exists that meaningfully improves over the
  baseline on the spec.
- **failure** — no usable improvement was achieved or an unrecoverable
  error occurred (out of credits, data pipeline cannot be made to satisfy
  the spec, training repeatedly fails). Failure is a first-class outcome,
  not a crash.

## Pipeline (run these stages in order)

For each stage, call `set_auto_stage(...)` first, then `load_skill(...)`
for the relevant sub-skill if you don't already have it loaded, then do
the work. The sub-skill SKILL.md will guide the per-stage details.

### Stage 1 — `rubric`
If the spec does not already include a scoring rubric / scorer, generate
one from `SPEC.md` and write it to `evals/scorers/<task>.md`. Reuse the
spec's own success criteria when present; otherwise derive criteria from
the task description.

### Stage 2 — `data_gen_draft`
Load the `data_generation` skill. Build a data-generation pipeline in
`data_gen/<task>_v1.py`. Run it with **3, 5, or 10 samples** for syntax
and quality validation. Read the resulting parquet back. If samples are
broken or off-spec, fix the pipeline and retry. Iterate until samples are
satisfactory — you are the only reviewer. When breakdown into smaller steps
stops helping or outputs look hallucinated, escalate the weak generator step
`random:small → medium → large`.

**Then validate the Stage-1 rubric on these draft samples before you ever
filter with it.** Run `run_scoring(dataset="datasets/<draft>", scorer="evals/scorers/<task>.md", mode="data_quality", model_size="small")`
and read `scores.parquet`: confirm the rubric scores the drafts *you* judged
good as high and any weak ones as low, for the right reason. A rubric that
flat-scores everything or rewards the wrong thing is not ready. If it
mis-ranks, revise `evals/scorers/<task>.md` (sharpen the rubric, add good /
bad / mid examples) and/or escalate `model_size` small→medium→large, then
re-check — before it is used to filter in Stage 4. Carry the validated
`model_size` forward to Stage 4.

### Stage 3 — `data_gen_validation`
Scale the same pipeline to a **validation set** (typically 100–500
samples; larger if the task is high-noise).

### Stage 4 — `filter_validation`
Load the `data_filtering` skill. Run scoring + the data filter on the
validation set with the rubric from Stage 1.

Use the `model_size` you validated in Stage 2 for both the scoring and the
filter, not the silent default.

**Soft threshold:** keeping ≥70% of samples is healthy. If the filter
discards more than ~30% (i.e. fewer than 70% kept), this is a red flag —
prefer scaling up the data-generation model (use a larger generator) over
loosening the rubric. Surface the warning via `set_auto_stage` note. Do
not loosen the rubric just to pass; that defeats the point.

**If the filter results themselves look mis-ranked** — high-quality samples
dropped or obvious junk kept — the judge, not the threshold, is the problem.
Escalate `model_size` small→medium→large and re-run before touching the
threshold.

### Stage 5 — `baseline_eval`
Load the `evaluation` skill. Run a zero-shot evaluation of the base model
on the filtered validation set, using the prompting style implied by the
spec (chat for chat tasks, tool-calling for tool-use tasks). **Always
supply a baseline system prompt** — use `prompts/{task}_v0.md` if it
exists, otherwise generate a minimal one from `SPEC.md` and write it
there before running. Without a system prompt the base model scores near
zero and the comparison to later stages is uninformative. Record the
baseline score — every later score is judged relative to it.

### Stage 6 — `sft_initial`
Load the `train` skill. Scale data generation to a **small training set
(~2,000 samples)**, rerun scoring + filtering, then run an initial SFT.

After training finishes, score the checkpoint against the validation set.

**Soft success bar:** prefer an absolute score around 7/10. But the right
bar depends on baseline:

- baseline ≈ 1–3/10 → 6/10 is already a solid result; aim higher only
  if the data supports it.
- baseline ≈ 4–6/10 → aim for ≥7/10.
- baseline already ≥7/10 → aim for at least +1.0 absolute improvement.
- improvement < ~0.5 over baseline with no clear trajectory → this is a
  failure signal. Escalate in this order (the `failure_analysis` routing):
  1. **Check the FILTERED training-set size first** (`training_status`'s
     "Data:" line / the dataset summary). Filtering can shrink a nominal
     2k generation well below 2k effective rows — below ~2k, generate more
     data to reach ≥2k good samples and retry SFT before blaming the model.
  2. With ≥2k rows and the data + scorer checked out, step **up one model
     size** (e.g. 1.2B → 2.6B or 8B-A1B) within the inference budget and
     retry the initial SFT once — a model that is simply too small won't be
     rescued by more data.
  3. If a larger size still can't clear the bar, load the `failure_analysis`
     skill (report `set_auto_stage('failure_analysis', ...)` while
     iterating) and run its qualitative probe-set loop once — targeted
     supplemental data sometimes unblocks what scaling can't. Only when that
     too is exhausted within the inference budget, call
     `exit_auto_mode("failure", ...)` rather than burning compute on
     Stages 7–8.

### Stage 7 — `sft_scaled`
On a successful initial SFT, scale training data further (**~10,000–
20,000 samples**) and run SFT again at default hyperparameters. More data
is the lever here; do not sweep. Training already keeps the best checkpoint
by validation loss, so the epoch count needs no search of its own.

If the scaled run lands *just* short of the bar and more data has stopped
helping, a hyperparameter sweep (`enable_sweep=true`) is the last thing to
try before Stage 8 — it costs several times a normal run for typically a
fraction of a point, so it is a final move, not a routine one.

**If the scaled SFT already clears the success bar (e.g. ≥8/10, or the
baseline-relative target from Stage 6), skip Stage 8** and go straight to
`final_report` — DPO on an already-good checkpoint risks a regression and
burns compute for little headroom. Run DPO only when the score is close
but not there and the remaining failures look like consistent, fixable
modes.

### Stage 8 — `dpo`
Run **on-policy DPO** on top of the best SFT checkpoint. Default to
**3–5 iterations**, score against the validation set after each
iteration. **Stop early** if you see a regression (drop in score
compared to the previous iteration) — DPO instability is real and more
iterations can hurt.

If DPO also fails to reach the bar, load the `failure_analysis` skill
(report `set_auto_stage('failure_analysis', ...)`) and run one round of
its qualitative loop — probe set, failure patterns, targeted supplemental
data, retrain — before concluding failure.

### Stage 9 — `final_report`
Pick the best-scoring checkpoint across the entire run (could be from
Stage 7 or any DPO iteration in Stage 8). Print the standard results
table summarizing baseline vs. SFT vs. DPO scores, dataset sizes, and
chosen hyperparameters. Then call `exit_auto_mode("success", "<short
summary>")`.

## Dealing with ambiguity

The spec may not specify everything — base model, target model size,
prompting style, data format, etc. When ambiguous:

- **Model size:** If the spec/user named a size, use it. Otherwise **start in
  the middle — the 1.2B model** — never an extreme. Then adapt from evidence: if
  the task proves very simple (strong zero-shot baseline, clean data) step down
  toward 350M; if it proves too hard for the size (very poor zero-shot baseline
  at 1.2B or above, or SFT plateaus well below target despite good data and a
  sane scorer) step up to 2.6B or the 8B-A1B MoE. The zero-shot baseline score
  is your first signal for where to land — except for the 230M/350M, which
  routinely score near the floor zero-shot (they can't follow a multi-rule
  prompt) and still fine-tune well on narrow tasks. Judge those sizes by the
  pilot SFT, never by the zero-shot baseline alone.
- **Base vs. instruct checkpoint:** either works as the SFT base; at the large
  dataset sizes auto mode generates the gap is small, with a slight edge to the
  `-Base` checkpoint. Default to the instruct/no-suffix model unless you have a
  specific reason to prefer base. Avoid `-Thinking` checkpoints as an SFT base
  for non-thinking data.
- **Prompting style:** Infer from the task. Chat tasks → ChatML; tool-use
  tasks → tool-calling format.
- **Dataset sizes:** Use the defaults above (validation 100–500, initial
  training 2k, scaled 10–20k).
- **Anything else:** pick a sensible default, write it down in your turn,
  and move on.

Never stall on ambiguity. Never call `exit_auto_mode("failure")` *just*
because the spec was unclear — only call failure when you've genuinely
attempted the pipeline and a stage cannot succeed.

## Recovery

If a stage fails (pipeline crashes, scoring API errors, training
diverges):

1. Log what happened.
2. Try one or two reasonable fixes (re-read the error, edit the pipeline,
   regenerate the rubric, change a hyperparameter).
3. If the same stage fails repeatedly with no plausible recovery path,
   call `exit_auto_mode("failure", "<what failed and what you tried>")`.

## Stage names (canonical)

Use exactly these names with `set_auto_stage`:

- `rubric`
- `data_gen_draft`
- `data_gen_validation`
- `filter_validation`
- `baseline_eval`
- `sft_initial`
- `sft_scaled`
- `dpo`
- `failure_analysis`
- `final_report`

The TUI uses these to render progress; deviating from the list still
works but breaks the visual ordering. `failure_analysis` is a loop, not a
linear stage — report it while running the qualitative failure loop from
Stage 6 or 8, then return to the stage you escalated from.

## Maintain NOTES.md

Before finishing a work phase here (and whenever you make a significant decision
or launch a long-running job), update the project-root `NOTES.md`: what was
decided and why, which approach is active, what is blocked, and the explicit
next steps. A future session resumes from that file — write for a reader with
none of this conversation's context. NOTES.md is advisory prose; job status and
artifacts are always verified with tools, never from notes.
