    Parameters
    ----------
    script_path:
        Path to the ``.py`` pipeline file.
    num_samples:
        Maximum number of source items to consume (pure-generation mode) or
        cap on source items (bring-your-data mode). Pure-generation runs
        may *attempt* a few more than this — see ``_overcommit_margin`` —
        but never write more rows, and never read past the cap in
        bring-your-data mode.
    output_dir:
        Directory where ``data.parquet`` will be written.
    client:
        Pre-configured ``AsyncOpenAI`` instance pointed at api.lqh.ai.
    max_retries:
        How many times the engine retries a failed sample (fresh instance each
        time) before marking it as permanently failed.
    concurrency:
        Maximum number of samples generated in parallel.
    samples_per_item:
        How many times ``generate()`` is called per source item (only relevant
        in bring-your-data mode).
    sample_timeout:
        Watchdog on a single ``generate()`` attempt, in seconds (``None``
        disables it). Deliberately far above any healthy sample — the HTTP
        client already bounds each LLM call — so it only fires on a wedged
        pipeline. A timed-out attempt is retried like any other failure.
    validation_instructions:
        Optional text with LLM validation criteria (reserved for future use).
    on_progress:
        Optional callback invoked as ``on_progress(done, total)`` after each
        sample finishes (success or permanent failure), where *done* is the
        samples in hand so far and *total* is ``num_samples``. *done* only
        advances on success, so it repeats after a failure and a run that
        can't deliver the full count ends below *total* — the honest signal
        that the caller got fewer samples than it asked for.
